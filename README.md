# networkstatebookslist
List of books referenced or linked to in Balaji Srinivasan's The Network State book

## Notes to self: 
- I didn't add repeats until after the chapter People of God, People of the State, People of the Network. The Benedict Option was referenced a few times for example, going forward I'll add repeats as it'll be interesting to see what the most referenced books are. Once I re-scan the earlier chapters and add repeats, I'll remove this section.
